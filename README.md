Build files for chronic, recoverable Neuropixels 1.0 implants in mice

Chronic recoverable implant based off of [(Juavinett et al, 2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/47188) and modified by Janna Aarse, who generously shared her build files with me to modify. See also other chronic recoverable designs:
* for rats [(Luo & Bondy et al, 2020)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59716)
* Neuropixels 2.0 [(Steinmetz, Aydin, Lebedeva, Okun, & Pachitariu et al, 2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf4588)
